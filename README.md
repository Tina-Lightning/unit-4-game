# unit-4-game AKA *Crystal Collector*

This project is a jQuery Guessing Game

This front-end application the uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. This project highlights using jQuery to dynamically update the HTML of the application.

The game works as follows: 

* There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player is shown a goal number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it adds a randomly generated but specific number to the playerâ€™s total score.

* Each time the player clicks a crystal, that amount is added to the total score. 

* The player wins when their total score matches the goal number.

* The player loses if they go over the goal number.

* Each time the player wins or loses, their win or loss count increases respectively. 

* Also each time the player wins or loses, the game resets with a new goal number as well as different value crystals. Also, the total score is reset to 0.
